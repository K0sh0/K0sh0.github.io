    const definitions = [
       "The event or stimulus that occurs before a behavior.",
  "Any observable and measurable action or response by an individual.",
  "The event or stimulus that follows a behavior and can either increase or decrease the likelihood of that behavior occurring again.",
  "Any consequence that increases the likelihood of a behavior occurring again in the future.",
  "Presenting a desirable stimulus after a behavior, which increases the likelihood of that behavior occurring again.",
  "Removing an undesirable stimulus after a behavior, which increases the likelihood of that behavior occurring again.",
  "Any consequence that decreases the likelihood of a behavior occurring again in the future.",
  "The process of withholding reinforcement for a previously reinforced behavior, which leads to a decrease in the occurrence of that behavior.",
  "The process of reinforcing successive approximations of a desired behavior until the final target behavior is achieved.",
  "A method of teaching a complex behavior by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable steps and reinforcing each step individually.",
  "Providing a cue or assistance to increase the likelihood of a desired behavior occurring.",
  "The gradual removal of prompts or assistance as the individual becomes more proficient in a behavior.",
  "The ability to apply a learned behavior or skill to new environments, situations, or stimuli.",
  "The ability to differentiate between stimuli and respond appropriately to specific stimuli.",
  "A systematic process for identifying the function or purpose of a behavior by analyzing the antecedents and consequences surrounding that behavior.",
  "A plan developed based on the results of an FBA that outlines strategies and interventions to address and modify problematic behaviors.",
  "The process of breaking down a complex behavior or skill into smaller, more manageable steps.",
  "The initial level of performance or frequency of a behavior before intervention or treatment.",
  "The systematic process of recording and measuring behaviors or skills to evaluate progress and inform treatment decisions.",
  "A method used to identify potential reinforcers by observing an individual's preferences or choices among various stimuli or activities.",
  "A strategy that involves teaching an individual an appropriate communicative response (e.g., requesting a break) as an alternative to a problematic behavior.",
  "A structured teaching method that involves breaking down skills into smaller components and presenting them in a consistent and repetitive manner, with reinforcement for correct responses.",
  "A teaching approach that involves incorporating learning opportunities into naturally occurring contexts and routines, rather than in structured, contrived situations.",
  "A naturalistic teaching strategy that involves capitalizing on naturally occurring learning opportunities by reinforcing desired behaviors as they occur spontaneously.",
  "A naturalistic intervention approach that focuses on targeting 'pivotal' areas of a child's development, such as motivation and responding to multiple cues, with the goal of producing broad, collateral improvements in other areas.",
  "A type of verbal behavior where an individual requests or demands something, such as an object, activity, or attention.",
  "A type of verbal behavior where an individual labels or names something in their environment.",
  "A type of verbal behavior where an individual responds to a verbal stimulus without any direct physical prompts or cues.",
  "A type of verbal behavior where an individual imitates or echoes a verbal stimulus.",
  "The process by which an individual learns to respond differently to different stimuli or cues.",
  "An environmental event or condition that increases or decreases the reinforcing value of a consequence, and therefore affects the likelihood of a behavior occurring.",
  "A specific type of motivating operation that increases the reinforcing value of a consequence and the likelihood of a behavior occurring.",
  "A specific type of motivating operation that decreases the reinforcing value of a consequence and the likelihood of a behavior occurring.",
  "The process of associating a neutral stimulus with an already established reinforcer or punisher, so that the neutral stimulus acquires reinforcing or punishing properties.",
  "The reinforcement of one behavior while withholding reinforcement for another behavior.",
  "A type of punishment procedure where a previously earned reinforcer is removed or taken away following an undesired behavior.",
  "A systematic reinforcement system where tokens or symbols are earned for desired behaviors and can be exchanged for backup reinforcers or privileges.",
  "A punishment procedure that involves requiring an individual to engage in a specific behavior that is related to the undesired behavior, and often includes engaging in that behavior at an exaggerated level.",
  "A systematic approach to instruction and data collection that focuses on fluency-based learning and achieving specific rates of correct responding.",
  "A specific approach within ABA that focuses on the analysis and teaching of language and communication skills based on the principles of operant conditioning.",
  "A teaching approach that involves minimizing errors during the learning process by providing prompts or assistance to ensure correct responding.",
  "A teaching approach that allows for errors to occur during the learning process, with the goal of promoting independent learning and self-correction.",
  "The ability to imitate novel or untrained behaviors or actions after being taught to imitate specific behaviors or actions.",
  "The delivery of reinforcement after a specified period of time has elapsed following the occurrence of the desired behavior.",
  "The continued occurrence of a learned behavior or skill over time, even after the initial intervention or teaching has been removed or faded.",
  "A principle that states that a more preferred or reinforcing activity can be used to reinforce a less preferred behavior.",
  "The process by which an individual learns to follow instructions or discriminate between different types of instructions.",
  "The systematic reinforcement or punishment of behaviors based on predetermined contingencies or rules.",
  "The process of teaching an alternative, appropriate behavior that serves the same function as a problematic behavior, with the goal of replacing the problematic behavior.",
  "The extent to which the goals, procedures, and outcomes of an intervention are socially acceptable, practical, and meaningful to those involved.",
