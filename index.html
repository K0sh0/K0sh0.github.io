        "When a behavior is followed immediately by the presentation of a stimulus that increases the future frequency of the behavior in similar conditions",
  "A stimulus whose presentation or onset functions as reinforcement (an item may be preferred but does not function as a reinforcer unless it increases the future likelihood of a behavior). 5 types of reinforcers: edible, activity, tangible, social, sensory",
  "when a behavior is followed immediately by the removal of a stimulus that increases the future frequency of the behavior in similar conditions",
  "A stimulus whose termination (or reduction in intensity) increases the future likelihood of a behavior",
  "A behavior is followed immediately by the presentation of a stimulus that decreases the future frequency of behavior",
  "A behavior is followed immediately by the removal of a stimulus (or decrease in intensity of the stimulus) that decreases the future frequency of similar responses under similar conditions",
  "A stimulus change that can increase the future frequency of behavior without prior pairing with any other form of reinforcement. No learning history required.  UCRs are a product of biology. Examples: food, water, warmth, sleep. Also called 'primary' or 'unlearned' reinforcer.",
  "When a previously neutral stimulus acquires the ability to function as a reinforcer through stimulus–stimulus pairing with one or more unconditioned or conditioned reinforcers. Learning history is required.  CRs are a product of development. Examples: toys, tokens, money, social attention and praise.  Also called 'secondary' or 'learned' reinforcer.",
  "A high probability activity may serve as a positive reinforcer for a low probability activity. \nExample: Jason does not like to do his homework.  He loves to go swimming.  His parents tells him that first he must complete his homework, then he can go swimming.",
  "Reinforcement delivered on a schedule independent of the occurrence of the target behavior or response.",
  "When a reinforcer loses its effectiveness due to overuse.",
  "an observation–based method appropriate for children who are unable to select between highly–preferred and low–preferred items, those who engage in behavior targeted for reduction, or when the therapist is unfamiliar with the child. The child is given unrestricted access to a variety of toys and activities. The longer the child engages with an item, the stronger the inference is that the item is preferred.",
  "a trial–based method appropriate for children who have difficulty selecting between two or more stimuli. Also called 'successive choice'. A stimulus is presented and the child's reaction is recorded.",
  "a trial–based method appropriate for children who can adequately select preferred items from an array of two. Also called 'forced–choice'. Each stimulus is matched randomly with every other item in the set. Data shows how many times an item was chosen and then stimuli are ranked in terms of high, medium, and low preference.",
  "a trial–based method appropriate for children who can adequately select preferred items among a sizable array of stimuli. For assessments with tangible items (i.e., toys), it is also appropriate for children who do not engage in behavior targeted for reduction when preferred toys are taken away. All stimuli are presented simultaneously, the selected item is removed from the array, the placement of items is rearranged and the next trial begins with a reduced number of items.",
  "a trial–based method appropriate for children who can adequately select preferred items among a large array of items. For tangible items (i.e., toys), it is also appropriate for children who do engage in behavior targeted for reduction when preferred toys are taken away.  All stimuli are presented simultaneously, the item selected remains in the array and the items that were not selected are replaced with new stimuli.",
  "Provide reinforcement for every occurrence, or independent response, of the target behavior",
  "Fixed = constant, set criteria. Ratio = a certain number of occurrences of the behavior have to occur before one response produces reinforcement. Example: Fixed Ratio 4 (FR4) = reinforcement is delivered after every 4th independent response.",
  "Variable = changing, variable criteria; average of responses. Ratio = a certain number of occurrences of the behavior have to occur before one response produces reinforcement. Example: Variable Ratio 4 (VR4) = reinforcement is delivered after an average of every 4th independent response.", 
  "Fixed = constant, set criteria. Interval = Specific amount of time elapses before a single correct response produces reinforcement. Example: Fixed Interval 5 (FI5) = reinforcement is delivered after the first independent response that occurs after 5 minutes.",
  "Variable = changing, variable criteria; average of responses. Interval = Specific amount of time elapses before a single correct response produces reinforcement. Example: Variable Interval 5 (VI5) = reinforcement is delivered after the first independent response that occurs after an average of 5 minutes.",
  "An FT schedule involves providing reinforcement at predetermined, fixed intervals regardless of the individual's behavior. An example is a teacher who praises students every 5 minutes during a group activity.",
  "Reinforce some, but not all occurrences of the behavior or response",
  "To teach using mass trials means that you will present the same new acquisition SD repeatedly. Example: Delivering the instruction \"Clap hands\" back to back up to three times in a row",
  "Also called Interspersing trials; rotating between several targets. Example: You tell the learner to \"Clap hands,\" and then on the next trial ask them to \"Touch nose.\"",
  "Behavior that is reinforced through the mediation of another person's verbal behavior. Includes vocal (spoken) and non-vocal (non-spoken) behaviors (e.g. signing or writing).",
  "The \"input\" of language, the ability to understand and comprehend spoken language that you hear or read (how we receive information from other people)",
  "The \"output\" of language, the ability to express your wants and needs through verbal or nonverbal communication (how we express ourselves)",
  "The speaker repeats the verbal behavior of another speaker. Vocal imitation.",
  "The speaker asks for (or states, demands, requests) what they want or need. Controlled by motivating operations, not SDs.",
  "The speaker differentially responds to another person's verbal behavior.",
  "The speaker names things and actions in the environment",
  "Reading written words",
  "Writing and spelling words spoken to you. Taking dictation.",
  "This is a Verbal Behavior term. A mand is a \"demand\", or being able to request something that one wants or needs. Mands can be emitted through any form including sign language, finger spelling, picture/icon selection, facial expressions, eye contact, gestures, verbal approximations, words, and/or sentences.",
  "An environmental variable that (a) alters (increases or decreases) the reinforcing or punishing effectiveness of some stimulus, object or event; and (b) alters (increases or decreases) the current frequency of all behavior that has been reinforced or punished by that stimulus, object or event.", 
  "A motivating operation that increases the effectiveness of some stimulus, object, or event as a reinforcer (e.g. food deprivation establishes food as an effective reinforcer.)",
  "A motivating operation that decreases the effectiveness of some stimulus, object, or event as a reinforcer (e.g. reinforcing effectiveness of food decreases after a meal).",
  "Any communication made without using vocal speech, such as pictures, sign language, or electronic devices.",
  "PECS is a symbolic communication system for functionally non–verbal individuals. PECS helps individuals  with autism initiate requests and communicate their needs.", 
  "A discriminative stimulus is the antecedent stimulus that has stimulus control over behavior because the behavior was reliably reinforced in the presence of that stimulus in the past. Discriminative stimuli set the occasion for behaviors that have been reinforced in their presence in the past. In one example, the grandma is the discriminative stimulus for the behavior of asking for candy. In nontechnical terms, a discriminative stimulus tells the person what behavior is going to get reinforced—it signals the availability of a particular reinforcer for a particular behavior. The abbreviation for discriminative stimulus is \"SD.\" When given the instruction, \"Touch red\", the red card is the SD, because identifying it correctly will result in reinforcement.  Other color cards in the array would be SD (S–delta) because they would not result in reinforcement.\n\tExample: shoes, traffic light",
  "A stimulus in the presence of which a given behavior has not produced reinforcement or has reinforcement of lesser quality in the past. Example: when told to \"touch blue,\" a child touches the red card. Touching the red card would not lead to reinforcement.",
  "A single cycle of behaviorally–based and systematic instructional routine. Clear beginning and end. Components: SD, prompt (if necessary), response, consequence/reinforcement, inter–trial interval.",
  "Supplementary antecedent stimuli that are used to evoke a desired response. Prompts are provided before or during a response.",
  "Time between each discrete trial; The interval should be as short as possible so we can capitalize on opportunities for learning.",
  "Gradually fading stimulus or response prompts so that the naturally occurring stimulus eventually evokes the behavior or response.",
  "Begins with a prompt known to reliably evoke the behavior and gradually proceeds to less intrusive prompts.",
  "Prompting begins with minimal cues that systematically and gradually increase in intrusiveness until resulting in the correct response.", 
  "Initial trials are presented with full assistance; Designed to prevent learner errors using most-to-least prompting and fading methods.",
  "Reinforcing a behavior or response in the presence of one stimuli and not the other. Reinforce the correct response and never an incorrect response (e.g. a patient accesses reinforcement for touching a red card and not the blue card when given the SD 'Touch red'. Reinforcement for this response paired with that SD will strengthen this response over time).",
  "reinforcement system with 3 components\n1. Target behaviors\n2. Generalized conditioned reinforcers (tokens or points)\n3. Backup reinforcers",
  "items/activities that can be earned by exchanging tokens",
  "Uses reinforcers to guide behavior closer towards a desired behavior. Shaping occurs through reinforcing successive approximations that guide the target through incremental steps, ultimately leading to the desired goal.  Delivering reinforcement will not be black and white, right or wrong, as in DTT.\n\t*know 'reinforcing successive approximations' for the competency assessment",
  "the gradual and successive criterion change for delivering reinforcement for a behavior that is closer to the terminal behavior than the one that precedes it.",
  "are sequences of individual behaviors that when linked together form a terminal behavior",
  "Involves breaking a complex task into smaller, teachable units; Should be individualized according to the age, skill and prior experience of the learner",
  "Forward chaining refers to teaching a behavioral chain beginning with the first step: have the child complete the target step(s), at the beginning of the chain, independently and then prompt all remaining steps.",
  "Backward chaining refers to teaching a behavioral chain beginning with the last step: you prompt the entire chain of behaviors except the target step(s) at the end of the chain.",
  "a variation of forward chaining in which the learner receives training on each step in the task analysis during every session. The trainer will prompt any steps the learner is unable to perform independently. The chain is trained until the individual independently performs the entire sequence.",
  "When two items or activities are consistently experienced together, the perceived value of one will influence the perceived value of the other. Common term that ABA professionals often use to describe the process of building or maintaining rapport with a child.",
  "Teaching target skills within naturally occurring routines and activities (NET is often loosely structured and led by the child's motivation)",
  "a type of instruction in which a therapist uses naturally occurring 'incidents' or events to provide children with learning opportunities. Example: a therapist has a child fill in a word or phrase of their favorite song when singing together",
  "provides the practitioner with data about where the learner is starting, no prompting or reinforcement",
  "teaching phase; introduced immediately after the baseline; utilizes prompting, errorless learning and other techniques outlined by the BCBA",
  "The process of practicing the skill often and thoroughly enough to make sure the learner is able to use the skill when needed, in any situation or environment. This will help the learner to gain the ability to perform a skill/behavior under different conditions, the ability to apply a skill/behavior in a different way and also to continue to use/exhibit a skill/behavior over time.",
  "ability to perform a skill under different conditions (settings, people, stimuli & instructions); Generalization has occurred when the behavior/skill can be done in a setting, with different people, or using different stimuli other than how it was originally taught. Example: Learner will engage in the target behavior when given the instruction \"clap your hands\" but also \"clap hands\", \"clap\" or \"show me clapping\"",
  "Learning a skill/target behavior and then successfully demonstrating a variation of it in similar situations. The learner's responses will serve the same function as the original target behavior and achieve the same result. Example: If you teach a child to greet someone by saying \"hi,\" and then they begin to say \"hello,\" \"hey,\" \"what's up?\"",
  "the extent to which a learner continues to perform a skill after all or part of the intervention has been terminated; A new behavior is not considered \"mastered\" until it can be maintained.",
  "Everything we do. Behavior is observable and measurable.", 
  "What the behavior looks like.",
  "The magnitude or force of a behavior.",
  "The amount of time spent engaging in a behavior.",
  "Behavior results in escaping from or avoiding undesirable activities, people, settings, or situations.",
  "Behavior results in accessing attention from others.", 
  "Behavior results in access to a desired item or activity.",
  "Behavior that is intrinsically motivating. Occurs independent of the social mediation of others.",
  "What happens right before the behavior occurs.",
  "What happens immediately after the behavior occurs.", 
  "clearly and concisely describes the targeted behavior in observable and measurable terms. The definition will include the topography, how the behavior will be measured, and examples and non-examples of the behavior",
  "repetition of an act",
  "instances in which the patient repeats the same word/phrase of hearing it.",
  "instances of walking or running beyond proximity without permission",
  "any instance of dropping to the floor from either a standing or sitting position.", 
  "self-injurious behavior",
  "inflexibility to repositioning items, following a different routine, or changes to the environment.",
  "eating or putting non-food items in mouth",
  "regurgitating contents and holding in mouth",
  "consumption of fecal matter",
  "rubbing pieces of bowel movement in places",
  "The measure of the total extent of time in which a behavior occurs",
  "The number of times a behavior occurs",
  "The number of times a behavior occurs within a specified period of time; Rate = Frequency divided by the time period",
  "The amount of time between two consecutive instances of behavior; measured from the end of the first response to the beginning of the second response",
  "The elapsed time from the onset of a stimulus to the initiation of a response",
  "A time sampling method measuring whether a behavior occurred or does not occur during specified time period",
  "A time sampling method measuring whether the target behavior occurred at any time during a specified time period/interval",
  "A time sampling method measuring whether a behavior occurred throughout the entire interval",
  "refer to the real or concrete objects or outcomes that result from a behavior. Common examples of permanent product measurements are the number of completed items, creative projects, quizzes, homework assignments turned in by a patient",
  "An environmental condition or stimulus change that occurs prior to a behavior",
  "A behavior change strategy that manipulates environmental stimuli so behaviors targeted for reduction are less likely to occur.",
  "Establishes an appropriate communicative behavior to compete with target behaviors evoked by a motivating operation (MO). Use of DRA to teach an alternative communication response that is maintained by the same consequence as the problem behavior.",
  "Reinforcing only those responses or behaviors that meet specific criteria along some dimension (i.e. frequency, topography, duration, latency, etc) and placing all other responses on extinction",
  "Reinforcement is delivered for engaging in a behavior that is alternative to the target behavior\n\n–Examples: ask for a break instead of throwing materials, using a chewy instead of mouthing",
  "Reinforcement is delivered for engaging in a behavior that is incompatible to the target behavior. In other words, it is impossible to engage in the target behavior and incompatible behavior at the same time\n\n–Examples: Yelling and drinking, clapping and hitting, squeezing a ball instead of self injury",
  "Reinforcement is delivered whenever the target behavior has not occurred during or at specific times.\n\n–Examples: For every 1 min the child engages in any other behavior besides hitting, they receive a reinforcer",
  "Reinforcement is delivered if the target behavior occurs at a number or duration equal to or less than a predetermined criterion. If the target behavior exceeds the specified limit, reinforcement is withheld.\n\n–Examples: Reinforcement for hand raising 10 or less times, reinforcement for shouting out 5 or less times",
  "Reinforcement is delivered if the target behavior occurs at a number or duration equal to or higher than a predetermined criterion. If the target behavior is less than the specified limit, reinforcement is withheld.\n\n–Examples: Reinforcement for approaching peers 3 or more time",
  "a procedure in which reinforcement that is maintaining the target behavior is withheld, and as a result, the occurrences of the behavior will decrease. It is used in conjunction with reinforcement procedures in order to increase appropriate replacement behaviors.",
  "a sudden and dramatic increase in behavior that may occur when the behavior increases in frequency, duration, or intensity when reinforcement for that behavior has been removed. It is a temporary response pattern and will diminish and then stop as the reinforcement for the behavior no longer follows the voluntary action.",
  "when the behavior reappears for a brief period of time even after the behavior has been considered \"extinguished\"."
