        "When a behavior is followed immediately by the presentation of a stimulus that increases the future frequency of the behavior in similar conditions",
  "A stimulus whose presentation or onset functions as reinforcement (an item may be preferred but does not function as a reinforcer unless it increases the future likelihood of a behavior). 5 types of reinforcers: edible, activity, tangible, social, sensory",
  "when a behavior is followed immediately by the removal of a stimulus that increases the future frequency of the behavior in similar conditions",
  "A stimulus whose termination (or reduction in intensity) increases the future likelihood of a behavior",
  "A behavior is followed immediately by the presentation of a stimulus that decreases the future frequency of behavior",
  "A behavior is followed immediately by the removal of a stimulus (or decrease in intensity of the stimulus) that decreases the future frequency of similar responses under similar conditions",
  "A stimulus change that can increase the future frequency of behavior without prior pairing with any other form of reinforcement. No learning history required. UCRs are a product of biology. Examples: food, water, warmth, sleep. Also called 'primary' or 'unlearned' reinforcer.",
  "When a previously neutral stimulus acquires the ability to function as a reinforcer through stimulus--stimulus pairing with one or more unconditioned or conditioned reinforcers. Learning history is required. CRs are a product of development. Examples: toys, tokens, money, social attention and praise. Also called 'secondary' or 'learned' reinforcer.",
  "A high probability activity may serve as a positive reinforcer for a low probability activity. Example: Jason does not like to do his homework. He loves to go swimming. His parents tells him that first he must complete his homework, then he can go swimming.",
  "Reinforcement delivered on a schedule independent of the occurrence of the target behavior or response.",
  "When a reinforcer loses its effectiveness due to overuse.",
  "an observation--based method appropriate for children who are unable to select between highly--preferred and low--preferred items, those who engage in behavior targeted for reduction, or when the therapist is unfamiliar with the child. The child is given unrestricted access to a variety of toys and activities. The longer the child engages with an item, the stronger the inference is that the item is preferred.",
  "a trial--based method appropriate for children who have difficulty selecting between two or more stimuli. Also called 'successive choice'. A stimulus is presented and the child's reaction is recorded.",
  "a trial--based method appropriate for children who can adequately select preferred items from an array of two. Also called 'forced--choice'. Each stimulus is matched randomly with every other item in the set. Data shows how many times an item was chosen and then stimuli are ranked in terms of high, medium, and low preference.",
  "a trial--based method appropriate for children who can adequately select preferred items among a sizable array of stimuli. For assessments with tangible items (i.e., toys), it is also appropriate for children who *do not* engage in behavior targeted for reduction when preferred toys are taken away. All stimuli are presented simultaneously, the selected item is removed from the array, the placement of items is rearranged and the next trial begins with a reduced number of items.",
  "a trial--based method appropriate for children who can adequately select preferred items among a large array of items. For tangible items (i.e., toys), it is also appropriate for children who *do* engage in behavior targeted for reduction when preferred toys are taken away. All stimuli are presented simultaneously, the item selected remains in the array and the items that were not selected are replaced with new stimuli.",
  "Provide reinforcement for every occurrence, or independent response, of the target behavior", 
  "Fixed = constant, set criteria. Ratio = a certain number of occurrences of the behavior have to occur before one response produces reinforcement. Example: Fixed Ratio 4 (FR4) = reinforcement is delivered after every 4^th^ independent response.",
  "Variable = changing, variable criteria; average of responses. Ratio = a certain number of occurrences of the behavior have to occur before one response produces reinforcement. Example: Variable Ratio 4 (VR4) = reinforcement is delivered after an average of every 4^th^ independent response.",
  "Fixed = constant, set criteria. Interval = Specific amount of time elapses before a single correct response produces reinforcement. Example: Fixed Interval 5 (FI5) = reinforcement is delivered after the first independent response that occurs after 5 minutes.",
  "Variable = changing, variable criteria; average of responses. Interval = Specific amount of time elapses before a single correct response produces reinforcement. Example: Variable Interval 5 (VI5) = reinforcement is delivered after the first independent response that occurs after an average of 5 minutes.",
  "An FT schedule involves providing reinforcement at predetermined, fixed intervals regardless of the individual's behavior. An example is a teacher who praises students every 5 minutes during a group activity.",
  "Reinforce some, but not all occurrences of the behavior or response",
  "To teach using mass trials means that you will present the same new acquisition SD repeatedly. Example: Delivering the instruction \"Clap hands\" back to back up to three times in a row",
  "Also called Interspersing trials; rotating between several targets. Example: You tell the learner to \"Clap hands,\" and then on the next trial ask them to \"Touch nose.\"",
  "Behavior that is reinforced through the mediation of another person's verbal behavior. Includes vocal (spoken) and non-vocal (non-spoken) behaviors (e.g. signing or writing).",
  "The \"input\" of language, the ability to understand and comprehend spoken language that you hear or read (how we receive information from other people)",
  "The \"output\" of language, the ability to express your wants and needs through verbal or nonverbal communication (how we express ourselves)",
  "The speaker repeats the verbal behavior of another speaker. Vocal imitation.",
  "The speaker asks for (or states, demands, requests) what they want or need. Controlled by motivating operations, not S^D^s.",
  "The speaker differentially responds to another person's verbal behavior.", 
  "The speaker names things and actions in the environment",
  "Reading written words",
  "Writing and spelling words spoken to you. Taking dictation.",
  "This is a Verbal Behavior term. A mand is a \"demand\", or being able to request something that one wants or needs. Mands can be emitted through any form including sign language, finger spelling, picture/icon selection, facial expressions, eye contact, gestures, verbal approximations, words, and/or sentences.",
  "An environmental variable that (a) alters (increases or decreases) the reinforcing or punishing effectiveness of some stimulus, object or event; and (b) alters (increases or decreases) the current frequency of all behavior that has been reinforced or punished by that stimulus, object or event.", 
  "A motivating operation that increases the effectiveness of some stimulus, object, or event as a reinforcer (e.g. food deprivation establishes food as an effective reinforcer.)",
  "A motivating operation that decreases the effectiveness of some stimulus, object, or event as a reinforcer (e.g. reinforcing effectiveness of food decreases after a meal).",
  "Any communication made without using vocal speech, such as pictures, sign language, or electronic devices.",
  "PECS is a symbolic communication system for functionally non--verbal individuals. PECS helps individuals with autism initiate requests and communicate their needs.",
  "A discriminative stimulus is the antecedent stimulus that has stimulus control over behavior because the behavior was reliably reinforced in the presence of that stimulus in the past. Discriminative stimuli set the occasion for behaviors that have been reinforced in their presence in the past. In one example, the grandma is the discriminative stimulus for the behavior of asking for candy. In nontechnical terms, a discriminative stimulus tells the person what behavior is going to get reinforced---it signals the availability of a particular reinforcer for a particular behavior. The abbreviation for discriminative stimulus is \"S^D^.\" When given the instruction, \"Touch red\", the red card is the S^D^, because identifying it correctly will result in reinforcement. Other color cards in the array would be SD (S--delta) because they would not result in reinforcement.",
  "A stimulus in the presence of which a given behavior has not produced reinforcement or has reinforcement of lesser quality in the past. Example: when told to \"touch blue,\" a child touches the red card. Touching the red card would not lead to reinforcement.", 
  "A single cycle of behaviorally--based and systematic instructional routine. Clear beginning and end. Components: S^D^, prompt (if necessary), response, consequence/reinforcement, inter--trial interval.",
  "Supplementary antecedent stimuli that are used to evoke a desired response. Prompts are provided before or during a response.",
  "Time between each discrete trial; The interval should be as short as possible so we can capitalize on opportunities for learning.",
  "Gradually fading stimulus or response prompts so that the naturally occurring stimulus eventually evokes the behavior or response.",
  "Begins with a prompt known to reliably evoke the behavior and gradually proceeds to less intrusive prompts.",
  "Prompting begins with minimal cues that systematically and gradually increase in intrusiveness until resulting in the correct response.",
  "Initial trials are presented with full assistance; Designed to prevent learner errors using most-to-least prompting and fading methods.",
  "Reinforcing a behavior or response in the presence of one stimuli and not the other. Reinforce the correct response and never an incorrect response (e.g. a patient accesses reinforcement for touching a red card and not the blue card when given the S^D^ 'Touch red'. Reinforcement for this response paired with that S^D^ will strengthen this response over time).",
  "reinforcement system with 3 components 1. Target behaviors 2. Generalized conditioned reinforcers (tokens or points) 3. Backup reinforcers",
  "items/activities that can be earned by exchanging tokens",
  "Uses reinforcers to guide behavior closer towards a desired behavior. Shaping occurs through **reinforcing successive approximations** that guide the target through incremental steps, ultimately leading to the desired goal. Delivering reinforcement will not be black and white, right or wrong, as in DTT.",
  "the gradual and successive criterion change for delivering reinforcement for a behavior that is closer to the terminal behavior than the one that precedes it.",
  "are sequences of individual behaviors that when linked together form a terminal behavior",
  "Involves breaking a complex task into smaller, teachable units; Should be individualized according to the age, skill and prior experience of the learner",
  "Forward chaining refers to teaching a behavioral chain beginning with the first step: have the child complete the target step(s), at the beginning of the chain, independently and then prompt all remaining steps.", 
  "Backward chaining refers to teaching a behavioral chain beginning with the last step: you prompt the entire chain of behaviors except the target step(s) at the end of the chain.",
  "a variation of forward chaining in which the learner receives training on each step in the task analysis during every session. The trainer will prompt any steps the learner is unable to perform independently. The chain is trained until the individual independently performs the entire sequence.",
  "When two items or activities are consistently experienced together, the perceived value of one will influence the perceived value of the other. Common term that ABA professionals often use to describe the process of building or maintaining rapport with a child. Pairing activities should be led by the child's motivation and should include only non--verbal and declarative language which serve to share your thoughts and feelings -- no demands!",
  "Teaching target skills within naturally occurring routines and activities (NET is often loosely structured and led by the child's motivation)",
  "a type of instruction in which a therapist uses naturally occurring 'incidents' or events to provide children with learning opportunities. Example: a therapist has a child fill in a word or phrase of their favorite song when singing together",
  "provides the practitioner with data about where the learner is starting, no prompting or reinforcement",
  "The process of practicing the skill often and thoroughly enough to make sure the learner is able to use the skill when needed, in any situation or environment. This will help the learner to gain the ability to perform a skill/behavior under different conditions, the ability to apply a skill/behavior in a different way and also to continue to use/exhibit a skill/behavior over time.",
  "ability to perform a skill under different conditions (settings, people, stimuli & instructions); Generalization has occurred when the behavior/skill can be done in a setting, with different people, or using different stimuli other than how it was originally taught. Example: Learner will engage in the target behavior when given the instruction \"clap your hands\" but also \"clap hands\", \"clap\" or \"show me clapping\"",
  "Learning a skill/target behavior and then successfully demonstrating a variation of it in similar situations. The learner's responses will serve the same function as the original target behavior and achieve the same result. Example: If you teach a child to greet someone by saying \"hi,\" and then they begin to say \"hello,\" \"hey,\" \"what's up?\"",
  "the extent to which a learner continues to perform a skill after all or part of the intervention has been terminated; A new behavior is not considered \"mastered\" until it can be maintained.",
  "Everything we do. Behavior is observable and measurable.",
  "What the behavior looks like.", 
  "The magnitude or force of a behavior.",
  "Behavior results in escaping from or avoiding undesirable activities, people, settings, or situations.",
  "Behavior results in accessing attention from others.",
  "Behavior results in access to a desired item or activity.", 
  "Behavior that is intrinsically motivating. Occurs independent of the social mediation of others.",
  "What happens right before the behavior occurs.",
  "What happens immediately after the behavior occurs.", 
  "clearly and concisely describes the targeted behavior in observable and measurable terms. The definition will include the topography, how the behavior will be measured, and examples and non-examples of the behavior",
  "An environmental condition or stimulus change that occurs prior to a behavior",
  "A behavior change strategy that manipulates environmental stimuli so behaviors targeted for reduction are less likely to occur.",
  "Providing choices (programming, foods, reinforcers, order of activities, ways to transition, etc)",
  "High--probability request sequence/Behavior momentum",
  "Visual Schedules",
  "First/Then...", 
  "Enriched environment to provide access to sensory stimuli",
  "Priming",
  "Non--contingent reinforcement",
  "Scheduled breaks",
  "Provide different methods for completing a task (e.g. run/walk/hop, marker/crayon/pencil)",
  "Use timers (visual or digital)",
  "Prompt a mand for a break or more time",
  "Establishes an appropriate communicative behavior to compete with target behaviors evoked by a motivating operation (MO). Use of DRA to teach an alternative communication response that is maintained by the same consequence as the problem behavior.",
  "Reinforcing only those responses or behaviors that meet specific criteria along some dimension (i.e. frequency, topography, duration, latency, etc) and placing all other responses on extinction",
  "Reinforcement is delivered for engaging in a behavior that is alternative to the target behavior",
  "Reinforcement is delivered for engaging in a behavior that is incompatible to the target behavior. In other words, it is impossible to engage in the target behavior and incompatible behavior at the same time",
  "Reinforcement is delivered whenever the target behavior has not occurred during or at specific times.", 
  "Reinforcement is delivered if the target behavior occurs at a number or duration equal to or less than a predetermined criterion. If the target behavior exceeds the specified limit, reinforcement is withheld.",
  "Reinforcement is delivered if the target behavior occurs at a number or duration equal to or higher than a predetermined criterion. If the target behavior is less than the specified limit, reinforcement is withheld.",
  "a procedure in which reinforcement that is maintaining the target behavior is withheld, and as a result, the occurrences of the behavior will decrease. It is used in conjunction with reinforcement procedures in order to increase appropriate replacement behaviors.",
  "a sudden and dramatic increase in behavior that may occur when the behavior increases in frequency, duration, or intensity when reinforcement for that behavior has been removed. It is a temporary response pattern and will diminish and then stop as the reinforcement for the behavior no longer follows the voluntary action.",
  "when the behavior reappears for a brief period of time even after the behavior has been considered \"extinguished\".",
   "A comprehensive assessment and curriculum planning tool. This tool allows you to assess across 25 varied domains to get a complete snapshot of a child's functioning level, strengths, and deficits. Domains include self help skills, gross motor skills, receptive skills, group instruction, etc.",
  "The antecedent (precursor/setting event), behavior (what occurs), and consequence (what follows the behavior). Commonly referred to as the three term contingency. BCBAs will analyze the ABCs for target behaviors to determine what the function (or reason) for the behavior is.",
  "A target that is in the process of being taught. This behavior is not yet a known skill.",
  "The application of the science of learning to socially significant changes in behavior.",
  "A brain/motor speech disorder that affects the effectiveness of muscle movements necessary to say words, syllables, or specific sounds.",
  "According to the DSM-- V, these are defined as persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction across multiple contexts, and there is a severity level rating system based on the intensity of supports the individual needs to function. It's important to know that Autism is a spectrum, and no 2 individuals are the same. There is much variability amongst people with Autism.",
  "This is the board certification required for a person to become a Behavior Analyst, and it is recognized worldwide. In many states or with insurance companies, only BCBAs and BCBA--Ds are recognized as being authorized to oversee, manage, or supervise ABA programs.",
  "Chronological age is a person's age calculated by birth date. A developmental age is based on level of functioning/cognitive ability, and adaptive skills. For example a 7 year old child diagnosed with Autism could have the developmental age of a 3 year old.",
  "This means having multiple diagnoses at the same time, such as being diagnosed with Autism, OCD, and an Anxiety Disorder.",
  "When an individual has not had access to an item/activity. If a child has soccer practice, and runs for 2 hours, the child would be deprived of water and would most likely have an MO to obtain water.",
  "A child or infant may be given a diagnosis of Developmentally Delayed when they are not progressing as they should be and aren't meeting developmental milestones such as crawling, sitting up, using a pincer grasp, talking/babbling, etc.",
  "The DSM is a manual that catalogs all mental conditions, disorders, and syndromes and explains how to diagnose each one. It is regularly updated, and professionals have to reference the newest version when discussing, explaining, or understanding diagnoses.",
  "Vocally repeating the same word/phrase within a few seconds of hearing it. Instructor -- \"Okay, touch blue\" learner -- \"okay, touch blue\"",
  "Where the environment is changed to reduce barriers affecting instruction, behavior and teaching.",
  "Expressive refers to vocal/verbal behavior, and refers to tasks that require a vocal response such as tacting an item.",
  "The increase in frequency and/or intensity of behavior in the early stages of extinction.",
  "Skills of coordination and movement of the smaller muscles of the body, especially those of the hand.",
  "During a teaching trial, this refers to how many stimuli you should have presented in an array. E.g. \"Touch the cat in a field of 3\". This example means that the target stimuli (cat) would be presented in an array of 2 other cards. (So the cat, dog, and bird in a field)",
  "This is the process by which behavioral interventions are created. An FBA determines the function (or the reason) for a behavior, and then creates an intervention based on that function. A **Functional Analysis (FA)** involves manipulating the environment to understand the behavior, while a Functional Behavior Assessment involves things like observation, interview, and collecting ABC data.",
  "These are the activities we do using our larger muscle groups; like sitting, walking & jumping.",
  "Hand over hand prompting is a physical prompt where you place your hands over the learner's hand to get them to comply with a motor demand or directive.",
  "Acute reaction to sensory input (i.e. overly sensitive).",
  "Little or no reaction to sensory input (i.e. under--sensitive).",
  "The individualized curriculum plan that children, adolescents, or adults (usually up to 22) have if they are in special education. An IEP is a legal document.", 
  "An inclusive classroom is a classroom with both special needs and typical children learning together. Typically, General Education teachers cover inclusive classrooms, but there may or may not be paraprofessionals in the room.",
  "This is the plan of action or the strategy you will use to change a behavior. An example of an intervention is teaching a learner to request help instead of engaging in a tantrum.",
  "This term refers to having a learning environment where a learner can make academic and social progress with the least amount of intrusion.",
  "To mainstream a learner is to successfully integrate them into a typical classroom, instead of maintaining placement in a special education classroom. It also means they can perform grade level work and have play, adaptive, motor, and cognitive abilities comparable to typically developing peers. Main streaming is sometimes the long--term goal for a child in special education.",
  "This refers to when inappropriately placing items/toys, etc. in the mouth. Depending on the individual, mouthing might also present as licking items.",
  "Neuro--divergent is a term describing people with neurological difficulties or differences.", 
  "Neuro--typical is a term describing people who do not have Autism or neurological difficulties or differences.",
  "Displaying excessively repetitive and stereotypical behaviors. An example might be asking for a pretzel 18 times in 2 minutes. It might also present as repeating a line from a commercial over and over again.",
  "used to \"test\" a skill or to assess if a specific step is already in the learner's repertoire. Some BCBA's will have you do a probe trial for the first trial of DTT.", 
  "Prompt dependency is when an individual has become reliant on assistance with a task. This means that they have stopped attempting to do the task independently. It could also be that a parent or professional has prompted the learner to do a task a certain way so many times, that it is difficult for them to change the way they complete it.",
  "Punishers can be tangible, social, physical, etc. In behavior analytic terms, a stimulus is only a punisher if the target behavior preceding it decreases in occurrence in the future.",
   "Receptive refers to listener behavior. Specifically to tasks that require a nonvocal action or motor response such as touch, give, or point.",
  "The word \"recovered\" replaces words like \"cured\" or \"fixed\". A recovered individual has overcome the more disabling effects of their Autism diagnosis. They are able to be successful with minimum supports across a variety of settings (work, school, relationships, etc).",
  "For direct level staff, this is a credential that denotes the person has met specific education and experience standards as well as a credentialing exam. The RBT credential is now a requirement to work as direct ABA staff.",
  "This is when a learner engages in a vocal stereotypic behavior (see stereotypic behavior). It may include repeating, or \"scripting\" phrases or entire sections of a TV show, movie, commercial, etc.",
  "This is when a learner responds to a demand by either receptively or expressively linking several responses together. For example, if shown a photo of a firefighter and asked \"Who is this?\" the learner responds by saying \"Doctor/Teacher/Firefighter\".",
  "Sensory integration refers to different strategies or techniques used to meet, raise, or lower internal sensory needs such as weighted vests, specific sensory diets, or brushing procedures. Often an OT will recommend sensory integration via a sensory diet. Empirical data does not support sensory integration. As such, it should not be part of ABA treatment.",
  "Also called a School Facilitator; a Shadow is someone who goes into the classroom with a child and helps them integrate into the classroom environment.",
  "Speech and Language Pathologist (also referred to as ST), Occupational Therapist, & Physical Therapist. These are professionals who often work with individuals with Autism and other types of special needs to provide therapy services. These services are related to speech, movement, developmental goals, coordination, and functional communication. It isn't uncommon for these professionals (including professionals in applied behavior analysis) to overlap in the services they provide, such as teaching motor skills or visual performance skills.",
  "This is a Verbal Behavior term. A tact is being able to label or describe an item with stimuli being present. For example, a learner labeling the color of a ball he/she is holding",
  "This is the behavior of interest you are trying to increase, or decrease. The behavior program can address multiple target behaviors simultaneously, as part of a comprehensive treatment plan.", 
  "Reducing the demands put upon the individual in an effort to avoid or decrease frustration levels.",
  "May refer to changes from one activity or setting to another. An example might be transitioning from a preferred play activity to a work activity. Transitions are typically very difficult for individuals with ASD, particularly unplanned or abrupt transitions.",
  "An assessment and curriculum tool created by Dr. Sundberg. This tool focuses on verbal/language assessment to get a complete snapshot of verbal abilities, strengths, and deficits. Domains include manding, intraverbals, echoics, etc.",
  "Verbal Behavior is a field within applied behavior analysis based on the works of B.F. Skinner that focuses on understanding and teaching language as a behavior, and based on its function.",
  "When people use these terms they typically mean if a learner can talk or not. Babbling sounds are not typically \"verbal\", unless they serve a communicative purpose. The behavior analytic term for being able to talk is \"vocal\", not verbal. \"Verbal\" refers to forms of communication such as sign language or gesturing, while \"Vocal\" refers to speech/vocalizations used to communicate."
